# Chapter 4: BatchNode

In the previous chapter, [Chapter 3: Node](03_node_.md), we learned how to create individual "worker" units (Nodes) that perform specific tasks in our tutorial generation process. Now, imagine you need to process *multiple* items at once, like generating several chapters for our tutorial.  That's where the `BatchNode` comes in!

## What is a BatchNode?

A `BatchNode` is a special type of `Node` that's designed to work on a *collection* of similar things at the same time, or in "batches." Think of a factory with multiple workers all working on the same type of product. In our tutorial generation, a `BatchNode` allows us to efficiently handle multiple files, multiple abstractions, or generate multiple chapters, instead of processing them one at a time. This is much faster!

## Key Concepts:

*   **Input (Items):** A list of *individual items* the `BatchNode` needs to process. Each item is like a task. For example, a list of files or a list of abstractions.
*   **The `exec` Method (for each item):** The `BatchNode` calls the `exec` method *once for each item* in the input list. This is where the actual work on each individual item happens.
*   **Output (List of Results):** The `BatchNode` collects the results from processing each item and returns them as a list.

## How `BatchNode` Works

Let's think about our tutorial generation workflow and look at how a `BatchNode` helps:

1.  **`FetchRepo` (Node):** Fetches all the files in the repository. The output is the list of files.
2.  **`IdentifyAbstractions` (Node):** Takes the list of files as input and identifies key concepts in the code. The output is a list of abstractions.
3.  **`AnalyzeRelationships` (Node):** Takes the list of abstractions as input, and analyze the relationships. The output describes those relationships.
4.  **`OrderChapters` (Node):** Takes the list of abstractions and relationships and orders the chapters. The output is the order in which the chapters should be written.
5.  **`WriteChapters` (BatchNode):** **This is our `BatchNode`**. It receives a *list of items*, where each item represents a single chapter to write. Each item contains the abstraction name, description, and related code snippets. The `BatchNode` calls its `exec` method *once for each item*. The output is a list of the markdown content for each chapter.
6.  **`CombineTutorial` (Node):** Takes the list of chapter contents from `WriteChapters` and combines them into a final tutorial.

## Under the Hood: `WriteChapters` as a `BatchNode`

Let's go back to the `WriteChapters` node to see how a `BatchNode` is implemented.

```python
class WriteChapters(BatchNode):
    def prep(self, shared):
        # ... (Preparation of items to be processed) ...
        items_to_process = []
        for i, abstraction_index in enumerate(chapter_order):
            # ... (Create a dictionary for each chapter) ...
            items_to_process.append(
                {
                    "chapter_num": i + 1,
                    "abstraction_index": abstraction_index,
                    "abstraction_details": abstraction_details,  # Has potentially translated name/desc
                    "related_files_content_map": related_files_content_map,
                    "project_name": shared["project_name"],  # Add project name
                    "full_chapter_listing": full_chapter_listing,  # Add the full chapter listing (uses potentially translated names)
                    "chapter_filenames": chapter_filenames,  # Add chapter filenames mapping (uses potentially translated names)
                    "prev_chapter": prev_chapter,  # Add previous chapter info (uses potentially translated name)
                    "next_chapter": next_chapter,  # Add next chapter info (uses potentially translated name)
                    "language": language,  # Add language for multi-language support
                    "use_cache": use_cache, # Pass use_cache flag
                    # previous_chapters_summary will be added dynamically in exec
                }
            )

        print(f"Preparing to write {len(items_to_process)} chapters...")
        return items_to_process  # Iterable for BatchNode

    def exec(self, item):
        # ... (This runs for each item prepared above) ...
        abstraction_name = item["abstraction_details"][
            "name"

        print(f"Writing chapter {chapter_num} for: {abstraction_name} using LLM...")

            for idx_path, content in item["related_files_content_map"].items()
        )

        prompt = f"""
{language_instruction}Write a very beginner-friendly tutorial chapter (in Markdown format) for the project `{project_name}` about the concept: "{abstraction_name}". This is Chapter {chapter_num}.

Concept Details{concept_details_note}:
- Name: {abstraction_name}
- Description:
{abstraction_description}

Complete Tutorial Structure{structure_note}:
{item["full_chapter_listing"]}

Context from previous chapters{prev_summary_note}:
{previous_chapters_summary if previous_chapters_summary else "This is the first chapter."}

Relevant Code Snippets (Code itself remains unchanged):
{file_context_str if file_context_str else "No specific code snippets provided for this abstraction."}

Instructions for the chapter (Generate content in {language.capitalize()} unless specified otherwise):
- Start with a clear heading (e.g., `# Chapter {chapter_num}: {abstraction_name}`). Use the provided concept name.

- If this is not the first chapter, begin with a brief transition from the previous chapter{instruction_lang_note}, referencing it with a proper Markdown link using its name{link_lang_note}.

- Begin with a high-level motivation explaining what problem this abstraction solves{instruction_lang_note}. Start with a central use case as a concrete example. The whole chapter should guide the reader to understand how to solve this use case. Make it very minimal and friendly to beginners.

- If the abstraction is complex, break it down into key concepts. Explain each concept one-by-one in a very beginner-friendly way{instruction_lang_note}.

- Explain how to use this abstraction to solve the use case{instruction_lang_note}. Give example inputs and outputs for code snippets (if the output isn't values, describe at a high level what will happen{instruction_lang_note}).

- Each code block should be BELOW 10 lines! If longer code blocks are needed, break them down into smaller pieces and walk through them one-by-one. Aggresively simplify the code to make it minimal. Use comments{code_comment_note} to skip non-important implementation details. Each code block should have a beginner friendly explanation right after it{instruction_lang_note}.

- Describe the internal implementation to help understand what's under the hood{instruction_lang_note}. First provide a non-code or code-light walkthrough on what happens step-by-step when the abstraction is called{instruction_lang_note}. It's recommended to use a simple sequenceDiagram with a dummy example - keep it minimal with at most 5 participants to ensure clarity. If participant name has space, use: `participant QP as Query Processing`. {mermaid_lang_note}.

- Then dive deeper into code for the internal implementation with references to files. Provide example code blocks, but make them similarly simple and beginner-friendly. Explain{instruction_lang_note}.

- IMPORTANT: When you need to refer to other core abstractions covered in other chapters, ALWAYS use proper Markdown links like this: [Chapter Title](filename.md). Use the Complete Tutorial Structure above to find the correct filename and the chapter title{link_lang_note}. Translate the surrounding text.

- Use mermaid diagrams to illustrate complex concepts (```mermaid``` format). {mermaid_lang_note}.

- Heavily use analogies and examples throughout{instruction_lang_note} to help beginners understand.

- End the chapter with a brief conclusion that summarizes what was learned{instruction_lang_note} and provides a transition to the next chapter{instruction_lang_note}. If there is a next chapter, use a proper Markdown link: [Next Chapter Title](next_chapter_filename){link_lang_note}.

- Ensure the tone is welcoming and easy for a newcomer to understand{tone_note}.

- Output *only* the Markdown content for this chapter.

Now, directly provide a super beginner-friendly Markdown output (DON'T need ```markdown``` tags):
"""
        chapter_content = call_llm(prompt, use_cache=(use_cache and self.cur_retry == 0)) # Use cache only if enabled and not retrying
        # Basic validation/cleanup
        actual_heading = f"# Chapter {chapter_num}: {abstraction_name}"  # Use potentially translated name
        if not chapter_content.strip().startswith(f"# Chapter {chapter_num}"):
            # Add heading if missing or incorrect, trying to preserve content
            lines = chapter_content.strip().split("\n")
            if lines and lines[0].strip().startswith(
                "#"
            ):  # If there's some heading, replace it
                lines[0] = actual_heading
                chapter_content = "\n".join(lines)
            else:  # Otherwise, prepend it
                chapter_content = f"{actual_heading}\n\n{chapter_content}"

        # Add the generated content to our temporary list for the next iteration's context
        self.chapters_written_so_far.append(chapter_content)

        return chapter_content  # Return the Markdown string (potentially translated)

    def post(self, shared, prep_res, exec_res_list):
        # exec_res_list contains the generated Markdown for each chapter, in order
        shared["chapters"] = exec_res_list
        # Clean up the temporary instance variable
        del self.chapters_written_so_far
        print(f"Finished writing {len(exec_res_list)} chapters.")
```

Let's break down what happens:

1.  **`prep(self, shared)`:** The `prep` method creates a list of dictionaries called `items_to_process`. Each dictionary in the list describes what needs to be done for a single chapter. It includes things like the abstraction name, description, and related code snippets. This method is responsible for preparing the work for the `BatchNode` to process.
2.  **`exec(self, item)`:** The core part of the `BatchNode`. This method runs *once for each item* in the `items_to_process` list. It uses the Large Language Model (LLM) to generate the Markdown content for a *single chapter*. The code generates a prompt, makes a call to the LLM, validates output, adds heading if missing, and save the generated content to a temporary list for the next iteration's context.
3.  **`post(self, shared, prep_res, exec_res_list)`:** The `post` method saves all the results to the shared context.

In summary, the `WriteChapters` is responsible for writing multiple chapters in parallel.

## Analogy: The Writing Factory

Think of `WriteChapters` as a writing factory.

*   **Input (Items):** The factory receives a list of "chapter orders". Each order specifies what to write (the name of the concept, the description, code snippets etc.).
*   **`exec` (Individual Writers):** Each chapter order goes to a different writer (the `exec` method). Each writer focuses *only* on their assigned chapter and uses the LLM to generate the content.
*   **Output (Combined Output):** After all the writers finish, the factory collects all the chapters and combines them into a single document.

## Benefits of Using a `BatchNode`

*   **Efficiency:** Processing multiple items in a single "batch" is often much faster than processing them one by one.
*   **Scalability:** Easily handle more items by increasing the "batch" size.
*   **Clean Code:** Keeps the code organized and easier to understand.

## Conclusion

`BatchNodes` are powerful tools for processing multiple things at once. In our tutorial generation system, the `WriteChapters` node uses a `BatchNode` to write the chapters for the tutorial. This approach makes the process faster and easier to manage.

In the next chapter, [Chapter 5: LLM Interaction (call_llm)](05_llm_interaction__call_llm__.md), we will dive into `call_llm`, which the `WriteChapters` `BatchNode` and other nodes use to interact with the Large Language Model (LLM) to generate the content for our tutorials.
